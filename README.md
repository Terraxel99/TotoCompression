## Introduction

TotoCompression is a tool I named after a french nickname that can be formed from my first name (Thomas -> Toto). This tool was done in the framework of the [Visual Media Compression course](https://www.ulb.be/fr/programme/info-h516) at the [Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be). The tasks that were to be done are available in the "tasks.pdf" file, at the root of this repository.

## Technologies 

The technologies used for this project are C++ with OpenCV library to manipulate the images. To automate the build, I used CMake.

I wanted to keep the project as simple as possible

## Features

For now, the program can read images and supports the following features :

- Reading an image and applying DCT to it.
- Reading an image and applying inverse DCT to it.

Note that the program supports both grayscale images and coloured images without any problem.

To compress an image use the following command :

```

```

To decompress an image use the following command :
